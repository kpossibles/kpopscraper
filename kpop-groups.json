In their early years, they were also known as the female counterpart of H.O.T., and raised phenomenal popularity at the time.[citation needed] S.E.S. is considered one of K-pop's first highly successful girl groups. They were challenged by groups like Fin.K.L and Baby V.O.X, which debuted soon after S.E.S. and also enjoyed success. The group officially disbanded in December 2002 after Bada's and Eugene's contracts expired, though Shoo eventually also parted ways with S.M. Entertainment in 2006. Their final release was the compilation album Beautiful Songs released in mid-2003, where they last promoted their last original single \"S.II.S (Soul To Soul)\", from the greatest hits album Friend.",
