Togeworl released their first song in February 2012 for a soundtrack.\nIn June 2013, she debuted as a solo singer even before Togeworl with the extended play A Voice, led by the song \"All Right.\" Later on September she released a second extended play in September, Her Voice, and a full-length album in November called Goodbye 20.\nIn April 2015, she made her comeback with the third extended play, Simple Mind.\nOn May 30, 2016, Mystic Entertainment posted an official statement announcing Kim's departure from the label after her contract has ended",
